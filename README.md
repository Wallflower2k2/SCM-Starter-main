# Function Frontend
In this project I have created 2-3 functions in solidity and then shown the values of those functions using frontend.

# Features:
. Check the user's name
. Connect to MetaMask wallet
. Display user's account address
. View user's account balance
. View Wallet Balance
. Deposit ETH into the ATM
. Withdraw ETH from the ATM
Please install Metamask before running the code in your system.
# Getting Started
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.
1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at ( http://localhost:3000/)

On the Frontend window , you will be able to interact with the components and deposit or withdraw ETH from metamask wallet.

**Deposit**
-- Helps to deposit ETH in the current metamask wallet

**Withdraw**
-- Helps to withdraw ETH from the metamask wallet
