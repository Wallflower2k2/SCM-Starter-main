# Description
So in this project I have created a calculator performing bit operations : AND , OR , XOR, so I have created three functions related to bit manipulation.

# Features:
. Check the user's name

. Connect to MetaMask wallet

. Display user's account address

. View user's account balance

. View Wallet Balance

. Deposit ETH into the ATM

. Withdraw ETH from the ATM

. A calculator to perform bit manipulation (AND,OR,XOR)

Please install Metamask before running the code in your system.
# Getting Started
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.
1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at ( http://localhost:3000/)

On the Frontend window , you will be able to interact with the components and deposit or withdraw ETH from metamask wallet.

**Deposit**
-- Helps to deposit ETH in the current metamask wallet

**Withdraw**
-- Helps to withdraw ETH from the metamask wallet

**Input**
-- Input two integers A and B to perform bit manipulations(AND,OR and XOR)
